Demonstrate your understanding of this week's concepts by answering the following free-form questions.

Edit this document to include your answers after each question. Make sure to leave a blank line above and below your answer so it is clear and easy to read by your project manager

1. If you were to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

HTML tags are used to separate sections of a web page.  This is often done with a <div> tag
However, this tag does not describe what is in this section.
Semantic HTML, gives tags meaning
For example we could use <h1> for a header, <p> for a paragraph, or <a> for an anchor tag.
This makes HTML easier to read for people and search engines.

2. Name two big differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.

Display: block allows you to control the width and height of the item while display: inline does not.
Display: block has a line break after it while display: inline does not.

3. What are the 4 areas of the box model?

Body, padding, border, and margin.

4. While using flexbox, what axis does the following property work on: ```align-items: center```?

Align-items would take place on the cross-axis. I think of it as the y-axis.

5. Explain why git is valuable to a team of developers.

Git allows you to have version control.
You might write a code and then update it with new code.
Each time you update the code, that version will be saved.
This allows you to got back to previous codes for reference or to fix errors.

Git also allows branching.
Branching allows one or more people to work on a code without changing the master branch.
Different groups could be working on different parts of the same code, but on different branches.
You can then merge these different branches later.

You are expected to be able to answer all these questions. Your responses contribute to your Sprint Challenge grade. Skipping this section *will* prevent you from passing this challenge.
